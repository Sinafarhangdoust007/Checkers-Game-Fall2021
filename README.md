# Checkers Game in C++

## Description
This project is a two-player Checkers game implemented in C++. It features a traditional 8x8 board, where players take turns moving their pieces, capturing opponent pieces, and promoting pieces to kings.
The game strictly adheres to the classic rules of Checkers and is played via a simple and interactive command-line interface.

The project is designed for educational purposes and demonstrates the implementation of game logic, user input validation, and algorithmic thinking.
